## 📸 Image Tips

### Choosing Great Images

- **Featured Image**: Use a landscape (horizontal) photo, at least 1200px wide
- **Gallery Images**: Try to keep them similar sizes
- **In-Post Images**: Any size works!

### Where to Get Images

- Your own photos (best option!)
- Free stock photos: [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com), [Pexels](https://pexels.com)
- Always credit if required by the photographer

### Before Uploading

Large files slow down your site. Compress them first:
1. Go to [tinypng.com](https://tinypng.com)
2. Upload your image
3. Download the compressed version
4. Use that for your blog

**Good rule**: Keep images under 500KB when possible

## 📝 Writing Workflow

### Recommended Process

1. **Write in drafts first:**
   - Click "Save" instead of "Publish"
   - Come back later to edit
   - Click "Publish" when ready

2. **Preview before publishing:**
   - Click the eye icon to preview
   - Check formatting and images
   - Make sure everything looks good

3. **Publish:**
   - Click "Publish" → "Publish now"
   - Wait 1-2 minutes
   - Check your live site

### How Long Does Publishing Take?

After clicking "Publish now":
- Wait 1-2 minutes
- Your site rebuilds automatically
- Refresh your homepage to see the new post

**Don't publish multiple posts at once** - wait for each one to finish building before starting the next.

## ✏️ Editing Existing Posts

1. **Go to "Blog Posts"** in the sidebar
2. **Find your post** in the list
3. **Click on it** to open
4. **Make your changes**
5. **Click "Publish" → "Publish now"** to save
6. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for changes to appear

## 🗑 Deleting Posts

1. Open the post you want to delete
2. Click "Delete entry" at the top (red button)
3. Confirm you want to delete
4. The post will be removed after the site rebuilds

**Note**: Deleted posts cannot be recovered!

## ⚙️ Changing Site Settings

### Updating Your Blog Info

1. **Click "Site Settings"** in the left sidebar
2. **Edit any field:**
   - **Site Title**: Your blog name
   - **Site Description**: What your blog is about
   - **Author Name**: Your name
   - **About Text**: Your bio or about section
   - **Social Media**: Instagram handle, Pinterest, email

3. **Click "Publish" → "Publish now"**
4. **Wait for rebuild**

### Adding Social Media

Just enter your username (not the full URL):
- Instagram: Just "yourhandle" not "instagram.com/yourhandle"
- Pinterest: Just "yourname"
- Email: Full email address is fine

## 📱 Using on Your Phone or Tablet

Good news! You can create and edit posts from any device:

1. Open your admin URL on your phone/tablet
2. Log in
3. Everything works the same, just in mobile view
4. Create and edit posts on the go!

**Tip**: The mobile editor is great for drafting posts. You might want to do final formatting on a computer.

## 🎯 Pro Tips for Great Posts

### Writing

- **Start strong**: Hook readers in the first paragraph
- **Use headings**: Break up text with H2 and H3 headings
- **Short paragraphs**: 2-4 sentences each for easier reading
- **Tell stories**: Personal anecdotes make posts memorable
- **Include details**: Specific details are more interesting than generic descriptions

### Images

- **More is better**: Use multiple images throughout
- **Vary the shots**: Mix wide, close-up, and detail photos
- **Show yourself**: People connect with faces!
- **Caption important images**: Use the text around images to provide context

### Categories and Tags

- **Categories**: Choose one per post
- **Tags**: Use 3-5 relevant tags
- **Be consistent**: Use the same tags across related posts

### Featured Posts

- **Keep it fresh**: Update featured posts regularly
- **Showcase your best**: Feature posts you're most proud of
- **Seasonal**: Feature timely content (holiday recipes, summer travel, etc.)

## ❓ Common Questions

### Can I schedule posts for later?

Not automatically, but you can:

2. Set the publish date to the future
3. Come back on that day and click "Publish"

### What happens if I lose my work?

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

- Check that you clicked "Publish now" not just "Save"

### Image not uploading?

- Check your internet connection
- Try a smaller file size
- Make sure it's a JPG or PNG file

### Getting an error message?

- Screenshot the error
- Try logging out and back in

## 🌟 You've Got This!

Writing a blog is a journey. Your first post might feel awkward, but you'll get more comfortable with each one. Focus on:

- **Authenticity**: Write in your own voice
- **Consistency**: Post regularly (even if it's just once a month)
- **Enjoyment**: If you're not having fun, your readers won't either!

Don't worry about perfection. Worry about sharing your experiences and connecting with readers.

Happy blogging! You're going to create something amazing. ✨
