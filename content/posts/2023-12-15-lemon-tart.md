After my trip to Paris, I became obsessed with recreating the perfect lemon tart I had at a tiny pâtisserie in the Marais. After dozens of attempts (my family didn't complain about the testing), I finally nailed it. This tart is bright, creamy, and absolutely luxurious.

## The Perfect Crust

French shortbread crust (pâte sucrée) is different from regular pie crust – it's tender, crumbly, and slightly sweet. The key is not to overwork the dough.

**Crust Ingredients:**
- 1¼ cups (155g) all-purpose flour
- ½ cup (60g) powdered sugar
- ¼ tsp salt
- ½ cup (113g) cold butter, cubed
- 1 egg yolk
- 1-2 tbsp cold water

## The Lemon Filling

This isn't your grandmother's lemon curd – it's lighter, more elegant, and perfectly smooth.

**Filling Ingredients:**
- 4 large eggs
- ¾ cup (150g) granulated sugar
- Zest of 2 lemons
- ½ cup (120ml) fresh lemon juice (about 3-4 lemons)
- Pinch of salt
- ½ cup (113g) unsalted butter, cubed

## Step-by-Step Process

### Making the Crust:
1. Pulse flour, powdered sugar, and salt in food processor
2. Add cold butter, pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs
3. Add egg yolk and water, pulse just until dough comes together
4. Press into tart pan, prick with fork, freeze 30 minutes
5. Blind bake at 375°F for 20 minutes, then 10 minutes without weights

### Making the Filling:
1. Whisk eggs, sugar, lemon zest, juice, and salt in a saucepan
2. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until thick (8-10 minutes)
3. Remove from heat, whisk in butter until smooth
4. Strain through fine-mesh sieve
5. Pour into baked crust

### Assembly:
1. Pour warm filling into crust
2. Bake at 325°F for 10-12 minutes until just set
3. Cool completely, then refrigerate at least 2 hours

## Tips for Success

**Don't skip the straining**: This ensures a silky smooth filling with no eggy bits

**Use fresh lemon juice**: Bottled juice just doesn't have the same bright flavor

**Low and slow**: Cook the filling gently to avoid scrambling the eggs

**Chill thoroughly**: The tart needs time to set properly

## Serving Suggestions

I like to dust mine with powdered sugar just before serving. Some people prefer it plain to see that glossy surface. Either way, a dollop of whipped cream on the side is never wrong.

The tart keeps in the fridge for up to 3 days, though it never lasts that long in my house!

## What I Learned

Making this tart taught me patience. You can't rush the filling or the chilling time. But when you slice into that perfect tart and see the smooth filling against the golden crust, you'll understand why French pâtissiers have been making this for centuries.

*Bon appétit!*
